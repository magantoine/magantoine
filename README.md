# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Welcome to my Github profile!

ðŸŽ“ I'm a data science master's student who loves diving into the world of numbers and patterns. Passionate about NLP, system architectures, large-scale computing, and statistics, I enjoy exploring the fascinating intersections between them.

Within this framework, we create SkillSkape, a comprehensive open-source synthetic dataset of job postings tailored for skill-matching tasks. We introduce several offline metrics that show that our dataset resembles real-world data. Additionally, we present a multi-step pipeline for skill extraction and matching tasks using large language models (LLMs), benchmarking against known supervised methodologies. We outline that the downstream evaluation results on real-world data can beat baselines, underscoring its efficacy and adaptability.              |   https://github.com/magantoine/JobSkape/tree/main  |
