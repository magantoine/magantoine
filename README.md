# üëã Hey there! Welcome to my Github profile!

üéì I'm a data science master's student who loves diving into the world of numbers and patterns. Passionate about NLP, system architectures, large-scale computing, and statistics, I enjoy exploring the fascinating intersections between them.

üîç My main focus is Natural Language Processing (NLP), where I get to play with the power of language and build intelligent systems that can understand and generate text. From sentiment analysis to language translation, I find joy in harnessing the magic of words.

üìÇ Here you'll find a collection of my projects, each reflecting my curiosity and dedication to unraveling complex data puzzles. So feel free to explore, get inspired, and let's embark on this exciting data-driven journey together!
